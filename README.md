## Description

This Project is for Challenge 04 of the Monash Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. In this challenge we have been asked to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code written. The app will respond to the user's input for answers to the questions and submitting their score.
